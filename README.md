# demo_LearnedWaveletFrameShrinkageNetwork_TMI
This repository contains the CNNs used in the paper "Noise reduction in CT using Learned Wavelet-Frame Shrinkage Networks" that is in publishing process at IEEE's Transactions on Medical Imaging.


The funding of this project was provided by the European Union through the Horizon 2020 “Next generation X-ray imaging system (NEXIS)]” under Grant 780026.

The CT slices in this repository were obtained from the low-dose dataset from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA). We thank the grants EB017095 and EB017185 from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineeringto to provide funding for the generation of the dataset used in this paper.
